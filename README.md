This game requires players to match elements as the its name suggests. A player is supposed picks a card, its supposed to be matched with a similar looking card

## How to play this awesome game

The player flips one card over to reveal its symbol.
The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
